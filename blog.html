												<h2>Best Practices for <strong>Survey Design</strong></h2>
											</header>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="participants.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<h3>Designing Effective Surveys</h3>
											<p>I always say that designing an effective survey is a bit of art and science. At the end of the day, 
											I want to design a questionnaire that respondents are inclined to complete, that gets my clients the information they want to learn, 
											that reduces respondent bias, and that is easy to analyze. To craft a questionnaire that meets these objectives, I have some basic 
											design principles that I apply to my work:
										<ul>
											<li> Be clear on what you want to learn</li>
											<li> Know your audience </li>
											<li> Maximize responses</li>
											<li> Utilize techniques that reduce respondent bias</li>
										</ul>
										</p>
										<p><strong>Be clear on what you want to learn </strong> </p>
										<p>It is important to understand and outline your objectives for the research at the outset of the work. I have been brought into several projects 
										to conduct analyses after data collection has been completed, only to find that it is impossible for the clients to get the answers they need for 
										their business purposes because of what was (and wasn’t) asked in the survey and/or how those questions were asked. This is why I encourage my 
										clients to think about the kind of story they want to be able to tell with the results; the questionnaire must be designed to capture the specific 
										type of information required for telling that story. </p>
										<p>If, for example, you wanted to be able to speak about how outcomes vary for different groups of employees, you would need to ensure that you are identifying 
											those groups in your survey questions. Say, for instance, you wanted to be able to understand whether employee satisfaction varied by department or by the 
											employees’ level of education; you would have to measure all of these details in your survey at the employee level (i.e., asking each individual employee to 
											indicate their department and/or education on the survey form). Otherwise, you simply could not explore the data in that way — because the exact information 
											you needed would not exist among your results. </p>
 </p>
										<p><strong>Know your audience </strong> </p>
										<p> You also want to be clear from the outset of the project who you want to talk to and how you are going to reach this population. Some clients need to purchase 
										sample respondents that have been recruited through panels  (i.e., a group of people selected to participate in market research studies who are compensated, in some form, 
										for their participation), while others have internal lists they can utilize    (e.g., customer information captured in CRM software). If you are purchasing respondents, 
										it is important to determine what specifications you want to apply in selecting your sample participants. If you are using an internal list, it is important to assess prior 
										contact with these individuals (e.g., marketing email open rates, customer engagement with your organization on social media, prior survey participation, etc.) and determine how 
										likely the population is to respond to the survey. You will also need to determine how you will encourage participation — that is, whether you are able to provide incentives for participation.</p>
										<p> What you know about your audience and what you anticipate regarding their willingness to engage in your research is also important to keep in mind as you think about the length of your survey 
										and the level of sensitive information you might be able to collect from them. And in all cases, you will want to determine what sample size you need (i.e., how many people you will need to participate) 
										in order for you to have adequate statistical power for the analysis.</p>

										<p><strong>Maximize responses </strong> </p>
										<p> Our human attention span seems to decrease more every day, so it’s important to keep surveys short. In fact, surveys should be even more concise when you’re reaching out to an audience you don’t regularly
										engage with, because these respondents may not feel there’s any real incentive for them to take part  in your research. You want to extract the maximum amount of information from your respondents that 
										you can, in the limited time and attention that they give to your survey.</p>
										<p> I advise clients to  require survey participants to answer each question (except open-ended questions), especially if you are purchasing the sample. Consider putting questions with more sensitive topics
										at the end rather than the beginning, and provide an opportunity for people to respond without being forced to give an answer that makes them uncomfortable; for instance, you can provide a ‘prefer not to answer’ 
										or ‘don’t know’ response option. Putting sensitive questions at the end (rather than up front) also has the advantage of being less intimidating to respondents — an important concern, since you want to avoid turning
										them off to the survey early on.</p>
										<p>An additional way to maximize the value that you get from your survey is by limiting the number of open-ended questions, and being strategic about where you place them within the questionnaire if you do decide to ask them.</p>
										<p>Most importantly, I recommend that you test your survey before launching and make sure the data is being recorded as expected, both in terms of tech (e.g., your data collection tool is programmed properly in order to collect 
										all responses accurately) and in terms of the responses being internally cohesive (e.g., your wording is not confusing your respondents in any sort of way that might cause them to contradict themselves).   </p>

										<p><strong>Utilize techniques that reduce respondent bias</strong> </p>
										<p>Biased or inaccurate information can lead you to make poor decisions. One way to reduce bias in survey research is to utilize some traditional survey design techniques.</p>
										<p>One of these techniques is to randomize response categories for a question, ensuring that respondents are seeing the categories in different orders. Doing this eliminates 
										the bias that might arise if respondents detected a pattern that might otherwise cause them to default to the top (or bottom) response.</p>
										<p>Other techniques to reduce bias include considering the wording of your questions, responses, and any introductory text. The wording throughout your survey should be neutral, 
										as you don’t want to influence participant responses. For instance, a question that asks, ‘Do you agree that the change in policy positions was the best move for the nation?’ 
										would lead individuals to respond more positively than a neutrally-worded question, whether or not they genuinely agreed.    Likewise, you want to stay away from absolutes like 
										‘every’ or ‘always’ in your questions, and keep your answer choices balanced too.</p>

										<p><strong>Keeping these principles in mind will help you develop a survey that is clear and concise for respondents and that helps you get the information you need to make data-informed decisions.</strong> </p>
