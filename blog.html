												<h2>Some Guiding Questions to <strong>Develop Your Research Plan</strong></h2>
											</header>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="brainstorm.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<h3>How to develop your roadmap</h3>
											<p>Sometimes I receive requests from prospective clients that center on a particular methodology 
											or analytic strategy. These types of requests are often posed something like this:
										<ul>
											<li> I need a survey of my customers — is that something you can design?</li>
											<li> Can you moderate focus groups of my members? </li>
											<li> Can you create a pre- and post-survey for my workshop?</li>
										</ul>
										</p>
										<p>While these types of requests are very focused on a particular methodology, it often comes to light once
										we talk about the problems they want to solve and what they want to do with the data that the method they’ve 
										requested is not the method they need. This is why, before we start to talk about methods, I want to 
										understand your business problem or why you are interested in doing the research. Specifically, I want 
										to understand who the research is for (e.g., your product team, your marketing team, your communication 
										strategies team, etc.), what you hope to learn, and what you plan to do with what you learn. Once I have 
										this information, I can help build out a comprehensive plan with recommendations for the methodologies and 
										analytical techniques that best meet your needs. </p>
										<p>There are a lot of research methods out there, and the best one for your project depends on your unique 
										needs. </p>
										<p>The first step in building out your research plan is to determine what you want to learn — identifying the 
										purpose of your research. Here are some questions to consider: </p>
										<p><strong>What is the business need driving your research?</strong> </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Do you want to understand your population better?</li>
											<li>Is there a problem that needs to be fixed? </li>
											<li>What key information are you looking to find? </li>
										</ul>
										<p><strong>What do you already know? </strong> </p>
										<ul>
											<li>What work have you already done? </li>
											<li>What secondary data on the topic is available? </li>
											<li>What assumptions do you have about your population? </li>
										</ul>
										<p><strong>Who do you want to talk to? </strong> </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Who are your target research participants? </li>
											<li>How big is this population, and how engaged have they been in prior contacts? </li>
											<li>Are there any expected differences between groups? </li>
										</ul>
										<p>Knowing the answers to these questions from the outset matters because it will shape the types of questions 
										that you will ask, how they will be asked, and to whom. </p>
										<p>The next step is to clarify what you plan to do with the learnings. Here are some common questions to 
										consider as you determine this: </p>
										<p><strong>How do you plan to use the results? </strong> </p>
										<ul>
											<li>How will the findings impact your short- and long-term strategies? </li>
											<li>What might change in your organization because of the research? </li>
											<li>What timeline must you meet with your research in order for the findings to be useful?</li>
										</ul>
										<p><strong>Who will have access to the data? </strong> </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Who are the key stakeholders? </li>
											<li>How do you plan to share the data and key findings with them? </li>
											<li>How will they use the data in their day-to-day roles? </li>
										</ul>
										<p>This matters because what you want to do with the work will shape the research design and analysis plan. 
										</p>
										<p>Let’s look at how the answers to these questions might help us develop a comprehensive research plan. 
										We’ll use the example of wanting to design a customer survey. Here’s how that conversation might look: </p>
										<p><strong>What is the business need driving your research? </strong> We want to understand how our most 
										engaged users are using our software. We are particularly interested in understanding why they are using 
										the features that they engage with daily and what barriers they are finding to incorporating our recently 
										released features into their regular use of the software. </p>  
										<p><strong>What do you already know?</strong> We know what features they use regularly and how often they 
										use them. We also have a pretty good picture of who our customers are, and we know who is most engaged with 
										the product. About 10% of our users are what we’d call ‘power users,’ and this group accounts for nearly 50% 
										of the sales of new services associated with the software license.  </p>
										<p><strong>Who do you want to talk to?</strong> We want to talk to our ‘power users.’ These individuals are 
										highly invested in our software, and our leadership team has set our annual goal of not seeing any churn in 
										this group, so we must focus on keeping them happy.</p>
										<p><strong>How do you plan to use the results?</strong> This data will be used by our product and marketing 
										teams to help them develop new product features, services, and marketing strategies. </p>
										<p><strong>Who will have access to the data? </strong> Leaders across the organization will have access to 
										this data and will package it for their teams to support the goal of better engaging and meeting the needs 
										of power users. </p>
										<p>This is a real example from my previous experience — and as it turns out, from this information, I 
										determined that a survey was not the ideal methodology to meet their goal. Instead, I provided the 
										following research plan outline: </p>
										<p><strong>Research Goals: </strong> </p>
										<ul>
										<li>Explore perceptions, opinions, behaviors, and attitudes of power users to develop new product features, 
										services, and marketing strategies</li>
										<li>Understand how power users are engaging with product features and services</li>
										<li>Identify barriers to feature or service use for this group</li>
										</ul>
										<p><strong>Methodology: </strong> </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Qualitative market research — focus groups of power users</li>
											<li>Idea exploration    and usage and attitude (U&A) study</li>
										</ul>
										<p><strong>Analysis Strategies: </strong> </p>
										<ul>
										<li>Deductive and inductive code development</li>
										<li>Thematic analysis</li>
										</ul>
										</p>
										<p><strong>Expected Outcomes: </strong> </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Gain   a better understanding of the perceptions, opinions, and behaviors of power users</li>
											<li>Provide data that can be used across the organization to meet the needs of power users</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Spending some time exploring your motivation for conducting your research, what you hope to learn, and 
										how you will use the data will help you develop the research plan that is best for your needs. </p>
